## The Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

> [!TIP]
> Big O is used to describe the performance of an algorithm.

### $O(1)$
The code below prints the first item of the array. The size of the array doesn't matter. The operation takes a constant amount to run.
```c#
public void log(int[] numbers)
{
  Console.WriteLine(numbers[0])
}
```

### $O(N^2)$

### $O(log N)$

### $O(2^N)$
