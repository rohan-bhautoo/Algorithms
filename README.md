# Algorithmic Topics for Technical Interviews

Algorithm exercises in interviews can cover a wide range of topics, and the complexity can vary based on the role and the company. Here are some common algorithmic topics that you might encounter in a technical interview:

## Array Manipulation:

- Find the maximum or minimum element in an array.
- Compute the sum or average of array elements.
- Rotate an array to the left or right.
- Implement algorithms for searching and sorting arrays.

## String Manipulation:

- Reverse a string or a sentence.
- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Find the first non-repeated character in a string.
- Implement string matching algorithms.

## Linked Lists:

- Reverse a linked list.
- Detect a cycle in a linked list.
- Find the middle of a linked list.
- Merge two sorted linked lists.

## Trees and Graphs:

- Implement tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Find the height or depth of a tree.
- Check if a binary tree is balanced.
- Implement graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).

## Dynamic Programming:

- Solve problems using a bottom-up or top-down approach.
- Examples include the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, or coin change problem.

## Search Algorithms:

- Implement binary search on a sorted array.
- Solve problems using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

## Greedy Algorithms:

- Solve problems that involve making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- Examples include the activity selection problem or Huffman coding.

## Hashing:

- Solve problems using hash tables or hash maps.
- Examples include finding duplicates in an array or implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.

## Bit Manipulation:

- Perform bitwise operations.
- Solve problems involving bits, such as counting set bits or finding the single non-repeated element in an array.

## Sorting and Searching:

- Implement various sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).
- Solve search problems efficiently using techniques like binary search.

## Divide and Conquer:

- Solve problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems and combining their solutions.
- Examples include the binary search algorithm or the merge sort algorithm.

## Backtracking:

- Solve problems where the solution is found incrementally by trying different possibilities.
- Examples include the N-Queens problem or the Sudoku solver.
