# Algorithmic Topics for Technical Interviews

Algorithm exercises in interviews can cover a wide range of topics, and the complexity can vary based on the role and the company. Here are some common algorithmic topics that you might encounter in a technical interview:

## Array Manipulation:

- Find the maximum or minimum element in an array.
- Compute the sum or average of array elements.
- Rotate an array to the left or right.
- Searching arrays.
- Sorting arrays.

    1. <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    
        - Given an unsorted array, sort the array in ascending order.
          
    2. <h2>Input</h2>
    
        - An array of integers of length N.
          
    2. <h2>Output</h2>
    
        - The sorted array.
          
    4. <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    
        1. Start iterating through the array from the beginning.
        2. For each element, compare it with the next element.
        2. If the current element is greater that the next element, swap them.
        4. Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.

## String Manipulation:

- Reverse a string or a sentence.
- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Find the first non-repeated character in a string.
- Implement string matching algorithms.

## Linked Lists:

- Reverse a linked list.
- Detect a cycle in a linked list.
- Find the middle of a linked list.
- Merge two sorted linked lists.

## Trees and Graphs:

- Implement tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Find the height or depth of a tree.
- Check if a binary tree is balanced.
- Implement graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS).

## Dynamic Programming:

- Solve problems using a bottom-up or top-down approach.
- Examples include the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, or coin change problem.

## Search Algorithms:

- Implement binary search on a sorted array.
- Solve problems using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).

## Greedy Algorithms:

- Solve problems that involve making locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- Examples include the activity selection problem or Huffman coding.

## Hashing:

- Solve problems using hash tables or hash maps.
- Examples include finding duplicates in an array or implementing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.

## Bit Manipulation:

- Perform bitwise operations.
- Solve problems involving bits, such as counting set bits or finding the single non-repeated element in an array.

## Sorting and Searching:

- Implement various sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort).
- Solve search problems efficiently using techniques like binary search.

## Divide and Conquer:

- Solve problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems and combining their solutions.
- Examples include the binary search algorithm or the merge sort algorithm.

## Backtracking:

- Solve problems where the solution is found incrementally by trying different possibilities.
- Examples include the N-Queens problem or the Sudoku solver.
